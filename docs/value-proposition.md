The purpose of our web application is to provide a platform for apartment exchange.  
Nowadays it is getting harder and harder to find an affordable apartment - especially for prospective families who want to move into their first family-friendly apartment. 
 Older people, on the other hand, often live in an apartment that is far too large because the children have already moved out. However, very few move into a smaller apartment because they are afraid of not finding a suitable apartment, or simply do not want to deal with the stress involved associated with the process. Apartment searches in large cities are associated with a lot of effort. A platform for exchange could make things easier here and ensure that living space is used more efficiently.

We limit ourselves to large cities and start with Berlin. We have also already defined a target group through the "PERSONA method". 

The website provides motivation for all of us in the group, as we too have experienced live how our parents, after we moved out, stayed in apartments that were much too large for them and we ourselves faced enormous difficulties in finding housing. 

But also for older people an apartment exchange can be advantageous. As an example, one could imagine that an older person prefers to live on the first floor, or an elevator could be an enormous relief for these people. Moreover, they could benefit from smaller apartments, which are by far easier to keep and cheaper to rent, since many seniors suffer from old-age poverty.
